Linux tools for exploring what your programs are doing

How do you observe what a program is doing?

Wizard School - Why you should love your OS
Systems calls - are awesome.. The main way that your OS interacts with Kernel

The case of the Mystery Config File
Does bash use .bash_profile or .bashrc!?

strace = wizardry
strace tells you every systemcall that it runs.  

ex: strace -e open bash
(Shows the files that are open when the program is called)

other calls to try:
write
execve
recvfrom

The Case of the French Website
A website presents 1 way in a brwoser, a separate way in curl

ngrepn(checking input / output on a given port)
tcpdump
wireshark
mitmproxy

The case of the slow program
Profiling using system tools

1 Too much CPU
2 too many writes
3 wait for a slow server

time - shows how long a process takes with breakdown of cpu/user/system  space

dstat - shows reads / writes to a disk
