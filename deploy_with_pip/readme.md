Shipit with Pip!
Jenkins, Fabric and Pip

Deploying should be as easy as pushing a button

Reverting should be as un-pushing said button.

Bad Deployment slows development

Code is not useful until it is being used.

You have have code thats ready to go, time to ship!

Shipping dosent always work out
-Different verions of the product based on location
-Users panic if things arnt working

Do you have more than 1 way to delpoy code across teams?
Not terrible, sometimes that happens.

More than 1 way to deploy code on the same team?
Not great, everyone needs to learn every process.

More than one way to deploy a single app?
Very Bad. not consistant.

PIP as a demployment tool:

-python and setuptools to build packages (Stored on private pypi)
(Mirrors code from Pypi.org)
-pip installs packages

-Jenkinds for testing and building new versions

-Fabic makes it all work

Application updates can be performed with pip install -u 

Good Deployments help innovation, bad deployments dont.

Deployment is never done, just in a particular state.

Deploy often, deploy quickly.
