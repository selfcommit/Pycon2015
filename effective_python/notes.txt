Cool tricks:

1. You can force the definition of keyword variables in a function with a *

example:
def foo(bar,*,foobar,otherfoo):
  print bar, foobar, otherfoo

in the call foo(10,15,12) python will reject the call unless it is formatted as

def (10, foober=15, otherfoo=12)

2. Generators (yield)
- Saves memory space, file can be of any size, iterates.
- Always use a generator, unless youve got a really good reason.
